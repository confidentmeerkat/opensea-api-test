This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.



Build a simple app to search for NFTs from OpenSea API.
https://docs.opensea.io/reference/api-overview

Following are the steps to follow:
- Connect to a Web3 Wallet, using https://github.com/Web3Modal/web3modal
- Display your wallet's balance for two currencies namely, ETH and USDC
- Build a Search component, which uses OpenSeaAPI in order to fetch data
- Have interactive filters such as Cost, Date etc. to filter data
- Lastly make the layout mobile responsive and performant.

Note: This task has a 50% weightage towards Engineering and 50% weightage towards Design Aesthetics.
Original Designs will be preferred, compared to out of the box UI library components.

Tech Stack: Use React.Js or Next.Js, alongside Material UI for components.
